**A note to those who are peer reviewing my work:**

For some unknown reason, the actual flexdashboard site linked on GitHub is not always updating properly, but you can still knit the index.Rmd file and see what it currently looks like. I've been working in the climate-data.Rmd file and then copying to and refining in the index.Rmd file.
