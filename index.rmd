**Data Source**

These figures utilize data from the [Climate Change in the American Mind (CCAM)](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/americans-climate-views/) project. Led by the [Yale Program on Climate Change Communication](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/) and the [George Mason Center for Climate Change Communication](https://www.climatechangecommunication.org/), CCAM consists of national survey data on climate change beliefs collected between 2008 and 2018 (excluding 2009) and includes over 20,000 data points.

[Raleigh Goodwin](https://github.com/raleighgoodwin) created the plots on this page using the [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html) package.

Column {.tabset data-width=350}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Next Steps

Planning to fix the x axis text to accurately display the years. R has been giving me a lot of grief about this, and none of the fixes I've tried have worked.

# OK, I am 45 minutes into this rabbit hole and feel like an ape coding. I had a similar problem on my project and solved it with a hammer. I could solve yours with a hammer, too. You could just rename the years by telling it to swap out values with this: harm_plot[1, 1] =2008 (but you'd have to do that 250 times which seems a little silly to say the least)

#But that is like the least efficient method I can think of. I don't know why the code you commented out doesn't work.

```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Next Steps

I'd like to model this plot similarly to the common Pew bar plot format, wherein the bars are stacked and all centered at the divide between support/oppose instead of being left aligned at zero. Would also be nice to label with the percent values on the bars. Trying to figure out how to get the superscript of the policy labels to show up correctly. I also think I might want to facet wrap this by political party affiliation/leaning. I'll just have to reformat the df a bit first to make it possible.

### About

Here is where I can put a description of intended audience and message/any other relevant information.

### Version 1

```{r}
pol_plot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Policy, percpol, fill = Support)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

### Version 2

```{r}
pol_plot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Policy, percpol, fill = Support)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma") +
  labs(y = "Percent of Responses")
```

### Version 3

```{r}
pol_plot %>%
  ggplot(aes(Policy, percpol, fill = Support)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma") +
  labs(y = "Percent of Responses",
       title = '"How much do you support or oppose..." (2018)') +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Regulating CO^2 as a pollutant",
                              "Requiring electric utilities to produce\n  at least 20% of electricity using\n renewable resources",
                              "Funding more research into\n renewable energy sources",
                              "Setting strict CO^2 emission\n limits on coal-fired power plants")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1))
```

When I was trying to stack them, the percents kept coming up weird. Eventually realized that's because it's working across years. To fix, I decided to only plot the most recent year of data (2018).
